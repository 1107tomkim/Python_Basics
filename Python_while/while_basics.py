# While loop is used for iteration when certain conditions are true.

i = 1
# The while condition iterates throughout the time the value of i is less than or equal to 10
while i <= 10:
    print(i) # Printing the number for visual
    i += 1 # Incrementing i value by 1, if not it will be an infinite loop
print("Dont with loop")
