# For loop is used to loop through a number of times

players = "I am a player!" # This is what we are going to iterate through

# Basic for loop
for player in players: # player is not declared and it can be called whatever you prefer
    print(player) # Will return the whole string thats been printed out character at a time

for anything in players:
    print(player)
